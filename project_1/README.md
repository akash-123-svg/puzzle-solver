# Problem Solving Techniques

### Project goal

### Restriction to use

### How to run

### Search strategies
A search strategy is defined by picking the order of node expansion, Strategies are evaluated along the following dimensions:
* Completeness: does it always find a solution if one exists?
* Optimality: does it always find a least-cost solution?
* Time complexity: number of nodes generated
* Space complexity: maximum number of nodes in memory

Time and space complexity are measured in terms of
* b: maximum branching factor of the search tree
* d: depth of the optimal solution
* m: maximum length of any path in the state space (may be infinite)

### Uninformed search strategies
Uninformed search strategies use only the information available in the problem definition
* Breadth-first search
* Uniform-cost search
* Depth-first search
* Iterative deepening search

### Informed search
Idea: give the algorithm “hints” about the desirability of different states. Use an evaluation function to rank nodes and select the most promising one for expansion
* Greedy best-first search
* A* search

### Heuristic function
Heuristic function h(n) estimates the cost of reaching goal from node n

Relaxed heuristic functions
* Pattern Database Heuristics 
* Linear Conflict Heuristics
* Gaschnig’s Heuristics

### Future works
* Try with advanced heuristic functions
